# Game Rules
In this game the deck is shared between 2 players, with the only carda vailable ranging between 1 and 11.
this twist for this game is that trump cards exist, which can change many aspects to the game.
each player starts with nine chips, and with a mixture of losing and trump cards set by the other player, can lose them very quickly.
The goal is by then of the fifth round, to have one player without any chips.
